## The Aims of the Project

As Group-1, we want to build a website in this project by using HTML, CSS and Javascript together. Our aim is to apply some Javascript codes in a simple website by separating HTML, CSS and JS codes from each other.

While using Javascript code, we will try to separate JS codes also from each other to increase readability and sustainability. The JS codes will be classified as init, listeners, handlers, components, logic and data files according to their functionality role.
